# Space-Roamer

The final project of the first year.

Space roamer is a 2d platformer set in space, it's your goal to pick up the scrapped parts from your ship to try and get away from the alien planet. But beware of the dangers however.

# Process & Production

We started the project off brainstorming about we were going to do, and how we were gonna do it. Eventually we had the idea to make a platforming game set in space.

So, we started out in our first sprint, it consisted of about 2 weeks. It was our goal to make a working prototype, and we reached it. We had most of the base features that we wanted in the game, every crucial part was there, Movement, Movable enemies and a working tile set.

In the second sprint, we focussed more on the aesthetics and animations side. While we couldn't fine tune it that well at the time, it worked to a certain extent. Furthermore, we completed the scrap collecting system and some UI elements.

In the last sprint, we mostly wanted to fine tune the game by redoing the animations, adding a game over and victory screen, add music and add a bit of parallax when moving through the level.

# Reflection

In this project I've learnt how to work in a multidisciplinary team and coordinate them. At the time it was really stressful, but it was a good lesson. It also taugth me to try and stimulate teammates that give up way too easily or don't work at all.
